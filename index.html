    <p>First post! Setting up my journal for a new side-project I started this weekend. I will try to post every week, if not more frequently on the progress I make. </p>

    <p>Quantamaniac is something I wanted to work on for a long time. It's a video game that I want to build, but making a video game as a solo-dev is a monumental task.
      After several discussions with ChatGPT, I realised that the overall scope I have in my mind will take at least 3 years to complete. So I need to first start small, 
      build an MVP and see if people even like the concept. Then I can plan on getting some funds, or to hire someone to share the workload. </p>
    <p>This weekend I simply tried scoping out the project, going into details, making a clearer picture of the world in my mind. I do have a full-time job where I'll be
    occupied most of the weekdays, so taking out time on a weekday will be difficult. I do plan to take out 1 hr at least on the weekdays, and more time on the weekends.
     This is not a good start tbh, but It has been far too long that I have ignored working on any side project - I have to start somewhere, and that's what I'm doing.</p>
    <p>I have decided to go with Godot Engine for developing the game, as the game I'm building is a 2D game, and it needs to be light weight. I am hoping I'll be able to 
      get relevant tutorials and resources online and will be relying on ChatGPT a lot. Unity Engine was more familiar as I have already developed a game on that before
    during the lockdown period, but I don't trust the company anymore after the recent pricing model debacle. Also, Godot has grown a lot now, and has an active dev 
    community around it who help each other.</p>
    <p>The biggest challeng isn't development though, it's the content. I need to create a ton of assets, videos, dialogues, etc. I am hoping I'll be able to leverage GenAI
    for the content. Another big aspect will be handling multi-player. But I think I'll first make a single-player version and then see how I can move to multi-player. 
    Another thing is that the game has to be available on all platforms - mainly mobile. But that should be fine, Godot can handle that.</p>
